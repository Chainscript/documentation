# Chainscript

Chainscript is an easy to use scripting langauge for writing, executing and verifing smart contracts.  It is written with JSON to make it easy for both humans and machines to process.

Chainscript smart contracts are transaparent, auditable and immutable.  The script is designed to be freely shared and executed by "agents".  Chainscript agents execute chainscript commands and return the results.  The results from an agent should always be verifiyable by public sources such as blockchain and bittorent. 

Chainscript is designed to accomodate contracts containing assets, profiles, accounts, events and more.  The scripts can be extended to include other types of information and commands.  Specific interactions with the contract can be authorized entities holding a private key.
